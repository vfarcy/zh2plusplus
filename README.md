A minimalist wordpress theme based on http://zenhabits.net/theme/, modified by Mike Walsh (https://plus.google.com/102887861371741311630) and myself.

You just have to copy this folder content to your wp-content folder, create a WordPress page called “Archives” and under the Page Attributes setting in the Page editor, choose “archives” from the list of drop-down templates, and you are in.
